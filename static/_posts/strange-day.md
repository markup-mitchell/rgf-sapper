What was I doing a month ago at 10:00 on a Thursday morning?

I suppose I'd have just finished the daily remote meeting with my team at work and would be pouring my second or third cup of coffee and starting into whatever work I was assigned to.

## Now

On this Thursday morning I'm home-schooling my 6 year old, flicking between a page of alchemical symbols in one browser tab and a page of circuit diagrams in another.

There was, of course, some context for this - he hadn't been assigned a neophyte curriculum in western high magick by his primary school.

## Connections

K had decided to start the day with drawing, which is what tends to happen if I'm not completely prepared to start a literacy task at the end of the daily Joe Wicks workout, or am otherwise distracted by the toddler.

So he was making up symbols, which has been a bit of a theme of late, and taking his cue from sources like [Ninjago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninjago_(TV_series)) and [Avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender) these turned out to be variations on the [classical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element).

I was trying to show him that there were already some well-established symbols for Earth, Air, Fire and Water, and (if I'm honest) I __was__ slightly hoping the magical aspect of it would spark his imagination, but he was more interested in his own representations.

The referents of his symbols could broadly be considered as forms of energy or force, and in comparing electrical diagrams I was reminded to try and tap into last weeks' interest in magnetism by building and electromagnet. 

Gawd. You don't need to tell me that stuff like that is too old for him, I know it. 

## Improvising

Taking inspiration from the kind of task on the school's more age-appropriate lesson grid, we looked for different examples of symbols around the house and having a general conversation about them.

It was interesting.

We talked about how symbols

- can convey meaning or obscure it
- transcend language
- use different levels of abstaction
- ought to mean precisely one thing
- are sometimes part of a system

## And

Part of the reason we weren't able to stick to the 'normal' schedule was that there was a video call planned as part of K's ASD assessment process, which has been ongoing for a year or more.

That was more decisive than I expected, too.

## So

All in all a very unusual day, even by the standards of global pandemic lockdown.
