It's Saturday night and I'm really not feeling like typing up some blog post about how my week has been.

Literally my sole motivation at this moment is the fact that I have a picture of a cool paper plane that uploaded straight to cloudinary and I now know is available as a pre-transformed thumbnail image for a blog post.

## Symbolic

**The Best Paper Plane** has been some kind of milestone on my Dadness journey for a long time. **I** remember being excited by paper planes when I was young. And although it's a schoolchild trope it hasn't curdled into something risably old-fashioned in the way that conkers has. Paper planes are timeless.

Well, I thought so. And maybe he's too young or something, but K wasn't enthused about learning to make a good plane via youtube. He wanted me to make it. Or rather, I bargained him into making his own version and I would give him mine once we'd flown them.

In the event K's plane performed better than mine despite a looser approach to folding.
