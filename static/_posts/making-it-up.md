Week 3 of home-schooling and I'm starting to get a sense of daily rhythm.

One result of this is that I'm not doing much in the way of preparation for these "lessons". Rather, I'm going in with - at most - a vague idea of a topic and hoping things sort of fall into place.

Unsurprisingly, this tends not to work too well.
