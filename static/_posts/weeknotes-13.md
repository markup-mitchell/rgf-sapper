## Wow

It's not like you think it's going to be, is it?

I hardly know where to start sumarising my first full week of this new situation. I started out thinking I was going to be capable of writing a short summary of each day: the activities we'd done, my reflections on how it had gone, what I wanted to change, ideas to add to the list...

Well, that's not going to happen! 

But a weeknotes aproach might work if I get a **lot** more efficient at figuring out what I want to say than I am right now.

So instead, I'll give an overview of the daily routine. I'd like to tighten this up as I go along and try to stick to a more of a schedule  - I think K responds well to struture and consistency.

## De Facto Days
### 09:00 - 09:30

[Joe Wicks's daily workout](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyCLoPd4VxBvQafyve889qVcPxYEjdSTl). I groaned when my partner suggested doing a daily exercise routine on Youtube. One week later and I would starjump over a cliff if this guy told me to. 

### 09:30 - 10:30

Maths and Literacy. I also tried allowing Art, but without a clear plan it felt like vague and dithery playtime, so I'm going to lock it down to an "academic" subject from now on, to clearly signify **School Has Begun**.

#### Maths

We have a book of exercises that's equivalent to the kind of things they do in school: complete the numeric pattern, more and fewer comparisons, some simple sums. 

I also used a suggestion from the school's list of tasks to explore doubling numbers up to 10. I spun that off into a conversation about odd and even numbers (which is another task from their list). I tried to have him understand that all the results we get by **doubling** numbers are **even**, and why that's not a coincidence. 

Another exercise was counting up in twos, which is also related. I feel like grasping these underlying principles is the important thing for him to learn at this stage, so that he's not afraid of maths and hopefully so that he will be drawn in by the purity and logic of it. He's much more mathmatically inclined than I was, I think. 

#### Literacy

The main learning tool has been a list of Fry's 100 most common words in English. I'm not finding a source for that which looks very canonical, but there's plenty out there and you know how to use a search engine.

Basically they're [sight words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_word) and they feel like exactly what K needs to learn right now for fluency of reading. 

I wrote the 100 words out on flashcards and we did variations on recognising them:

- showing them and putting them in piles of know / read / needs practice
- laying them out in a grid and picking off as many as we can 
- using them to construct sentences

I'm conscious we haven't been reading a book together every day the way we did when he was in school. That seems to spark much more frustration in him than working on words in isolation. 

### 10:30 - 11:00 

Snacks and playtime. K usually goes for lego.

### 11:00 - 12:00 

Vague activities that I try to keep scholastic in some sense. Art, discussions about scientific concepts, following up such questions with youtube videos. 

### 12:00 - 12:30 

Lunch 

### 12:30 - 13:00

Post lunch playtime

### 13:00 - 15:00

Outdoor exercise. We've done cycling trips to the local park and walk to the big park to look at frogspawn. 

## Complications

I have several challenges in the course of the day:

I don't know what's an approprate amount of time for unstructured play. K's school practises a "play-based pedagogy". How that translates to time spent with lego vs reading and maths, I do not know. 

R is two and a half and fond of attention. We're also trying to potty train her at the moment, which involves sitting her in front of the TV while she's on the can. Inevitably this clashes with the no-TV-in-school-hours rule and the siblings-must-be treated-comparably rule (which I, personally, do not agree with, but to K is sacrosanct).

## Overall

I think it's going pretty well. Just trying to summarise our week makes me realise how much good work we've done, since there's a ton of stuff I want to talk about here that I just don't have the energy for now. I'll try to write shorter observations through the course of the week, perhaps, now that I've talked about things at a high level.
