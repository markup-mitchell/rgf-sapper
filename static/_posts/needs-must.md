I bought the `rathergoodfatherhood.com` domain in 2018.

Child One was getting old enough that I could envision us actually having shared interests and Child Two was still an unusually jolly babe in arms. I was just transitioning into a new career as a web developer and I guess I must’ve been pretty happy as a dad…

…and/or thought I was pretty hot stuff as one.

I dimly recall imagining how my blog about the cool stuff I was doing with my kids would evolve into a fantastic repository of resources capable of restoring _the experience of childhood itself_ to some prelapsarian condition in which knots and paper aeroplanes could co-exist healthily with super-fun science experiments and MMO battle royale death matches in a child’s infinitely inquisitive mind.

And when that got too wholesome I’d cut through the treacle with some poignantly melancholy – perhaps even profound – reflections on my experience as a son and a father. It was going to be so good.

Well, I don’t know, I must’ve been busy or something because that never really came together, you know?

## But hey!
It turns out my job cut me loose just as the viral pandemic sweeping the globe caused the total shutdown of British schools and nurseries for up to 6 months! potentially longer!

How lucky can you get?!

So as I luxuriate in my options for edutaining a six and three year old in parallel day after day, week after week for months on end without relief from elderly relatives, it seems like a golden opportunity to revisit that dream.

This may be my final post.
