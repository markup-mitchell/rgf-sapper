I'm lucky enough to able to give the kids my full attention (more or less!) during this global health crisis. I'm not trying to fit in remote work around keeping them entertained - never mind educated - and I know there'd be a **lot** more stress in our house if I was.

So I'm trying to observe what works and what doesn't in our routine and amend it accordingly.

This is the basic "inspect and adapt" approach used in some software development practices.

## Separation of concerns

Another principle you hear about in web development is the idea that style and structure should be separated so that they can be dealt with independently. 

I'm running into an similar issue when doing numeracy and literacy exercises with K - I'm getting distracted from the cognitive task by the  way he forms his letters and numbers.

The upshot of this is:

- we lose sight of the central concept being learned
- we lose momentum and make less progress
- K gets frustrated
- I get annoyed
- I risk creating negative associations with the exercise

## Action

I need to either

Ignore the formation of characters for now and just get over my personal irritation and fear of bad-habit forming. 

Or

Split the tasks out into their own sections. 

It's easy to say the latter is the best choice, but we'll need to see how receptive he is to it. I may need extra incentives if the activity is repetetive and boring. 

So there's an experiment for me to try!
